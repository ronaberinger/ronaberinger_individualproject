    "A few issues I see in the data are a couple missing values. Devin and Ahmed are both missing their ages. Additionally, the distribution of the data is a bit skewed. The majority of players have a playing time closest to 0 hours, which could heavily influence statistical analysis. We may need to perform standardization. Furthermore, the data has a majority of players who are college-aged, which could affect the conclusions of the study."

    "Issues I can't see directly relate to sampling bias. The players in this study include only those who voluntarily joined the UBC server, and may not accurately reflect the entire population of Minecraft players. Moreover, the dataset only records the actions of the players while they are connected to the server, which could limit the predictive power of the data analysis."
